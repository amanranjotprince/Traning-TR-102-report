    <h1>Java-script</h1>
	<h2>Java-script</h2>
	<p>javascript is a cilent side scripting language. Its used to make web pages alive. When javascript was created, it was initially called "LiveScript".</p>
	<h2>Writing in-browser JavaScript and Developer Console</h2>
	<p>We have two options to place the JavaScript in the code. One is in the &lthead&gt section and the other is after the &ltbody&gt tag. But if we view other professional websites, they place their JavaScript at the end of the &ltbody&gt tag so that the DOM does not get affected.</p>
	<h2>Variables, Data Types and Operators in JavaScript </h2>
	<p>variables are the data that stores value. Here are two types of operators present in JavaScript- Binary Operators and Unary Operators. Unary Operators work only on 1 operand. For example, 3+4. On the other hand, Binary operators work only on 2 operands. For example, x= x+6. Here ‘=’ and ‘+’ are two operands.</p>
	<h2>Strings in JavaScript </h2>
	<p>The String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.</p>
	<h2>String Function in JavaScript</h2>
	<p>IndexOf() function is used here to locate the position of any string It gives the first occurrence of the substring.<br>To get the position of the last substring, we can use the function lastIndexOf()<br>To get a substring from a string  we can use the slice()<br>We can also replace a particular string to another string with the help of replace() function<br> To concat any two strings, we can take the help of concat() function<br>To remove all the white spaces in the string, we can use trim() function<br>To extract any character from a string, we can use charAt() function</p>
	<h2>Scope, If-else Conditionals & Switch Case in JavaScript </h2>
	<p>the value of the variable gets easily changed and it can create a problem if we do not remember the initial value given the variable. It is because the scope of var is global here. But if we declare the var inside any function, then its scope will remain under that function. However, it is highly recommended to use let instead of var to avoid confusion of the scope of the variable. we have declared a as a constant, therefore, its value cannot be changed further by any means. <br>Conditional Statements<br>Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.<br>You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.<br>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:<br>
    Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true<br>
    Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false<br>
    Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false<br>
    Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed<br></p>
	<h2>Arrays & Objects in JavaScript</h2>
	<p>The object class represents one of JavaScript’s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor. we have two types of values used in JavaScript- primitive and reference. To be more simple, either we create objects or primitive data types.An array can contain any type of value in it whether it is a string, integer, or boolean. Arrays are important because they make it easier to iterate through each and every element present in DOM. We can also create arrays with the help of a new keywordIn this way, an array will be treated as an object. The new keyword is used to create a new object. To know the length of an array, we can use the length function However, to sort this array, we can use sort() function</p>
	<h2>Functions in JavaScript</h2>
	<p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).<br>
	Example<br>
	// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2<br>
	function myFunction(p1, p2) {<br>
	return p1 * p2;<br>
	}<br>
	JavaScript Function Syntax<br>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().<br>Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).<br>The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:(parameter1, parameter2, ...)<br>The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}<br>
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    <br>// code to be executed
    <br>}
    <br>Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.<br>Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.<br>Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.</p>
